			</h2>
			<p>He entered the cool dusk through the porch, and, looking down the pillared hall, saw beyond the fountain a gleam of gold, and when he came past the said fountain he looked up to the high-seat, and lo! the Lady sitting there clad in her queenly raiment.  She called to him, and he came; and she hailed him, and spake graciously and calmly, yet as if she knew nought of him save as the leal servant of her, a high Lady.  “Squire,” she said, “we have deemed it meet to have the hide of the servant of the Enemy, the lion to wit, whom thou slewest yesterday, for a carpet to our feet; wherefore go now, take thy wood-knife, and flay the beast, and bring me home his skin.  This shall be all thy service for this day, so mayst thou do it at thine own leisure, and not weary thyself.  May good go with thee.”</p>
			<p>He bent the knee before her, and she smiled on him graciously, but reached out no hand for him to kiss, and heeded him but little.  Wherefore, in spite of himself, and though he knew somewhat of her guile, he could not help marvelling that this should be she who had lain in his arms nightlong but of late.</p>
			<p>Howso that might be, he took his way toward the thicket where he had slain the lion, and came thither by then it was afternoon, at the hottest of the day.  So he entered therein, and came to the very place whereas the Lady had lain, when she fell down before the terror of the lion; and there was the mark of her body on the grass where she had lain that while, like as it were the form of a hare.  But when Walter went on to where he had slain that great beast, lo! he was gone, and there was no sign of him; but there were Walter’s own footprints, and the two shafts which he had shot, one feathered red, and one blue.  He said at first: Belike someone hath been here, and hath had the carcase away.  Then he laughed in very despite, and said: How may that be, since there are no signs of dragging away of so huge a body, and no blood or fur on the grass if they had cut him up, and moreover no trampling of feet, as if there had been many men at the deed.  Then was he all abashed, and again laughed in scorn of himself, and said: Forsooth I deemed I had done manly; but now forsooth I shot nought, and nought there was before the sword of my father’s son.  And what may I deem now, but that this is a land of mere lies, and that there is nought real and alive therein save me.  Yea, belike even these trees and the green grass will presently depart from me, and leave me falling down through the clouds.</p>
			<p>Therewith he turned away, and gat him to the road that led to the Golden House, wondering what next should befall him, and going slowly as he pondered his case.  So came he to that first thicket where they had lost their quarry by water; so he entered the same, musing, and bathed him in the pool that was therein, after he had wandered about it awhile, and found nothing new.</p>
			<p>So again he set him to the homeward road, when the day was now waning, and it was near sunset that he was come nigh unto the house, though it was hidden from him as then by a low bent that rose before him; and there he abode and looked about him.</p>
			<p>Now as he looked, over the said bent came the figure of a woman, who stayed on the brow thereof and looked all about her, and then ran swiftly down to meet Walter, who saw at once that it was the Maid.</p>
			<p>She made no stay then till she was but three paces from him, and then she stooped down and made the sign to him, and then spake to him breathlessly, and said: “Hearken! but speak not till I have done: I bade thee tonight’s meeting because I saw that there was one anigh whom I must needs beguile.  But by thine oath, and thy love, and all that thou art, I adjure thee come not unto me this night as I bade thee! but be hidden in the hazel-copse outside the house, as it draws toward midnight, and abide me there.  Dost thou hearken, and wilt thou?  Say yes or no in haste, for I may not tarry a moment of time.  Who knoweth what is behind me?”</p>
			<p>“Yes,” said Walter hastily; “but friend and love⁠—”</p>
			<p>“No more,” she said; “hope the best;” and turning from him she ran away swiftly, not by the way she had come, but sideways, as though to reach the house by fetching a compass.</p>
			<p>But Walter went slowly on his way, thinking within himself that now at that present moment there was nought for it but to refrain him from doing, and to let others do; yet deemed he that it was little manly to be as the pawn upon the board, pushed about by the will of others.</p>
			<p>Then, as he went, he bethought him of the Maiden’s face and aspect, as she came running to him, and stood before him for that minute; and all eagerness he saw in her, and sore love of him, and distress of soul, all blent together.</p>
			<p>So came he to the brow of the bent whence he could see lying before him, scarce more than a bow-shot away, the Golden House now gilded again and reddened by the setting sun.  And even therewith came a gay image toward him, flashing back the level rays from gold and steel and silver; and lo! there was come the King’s Son.  They met presently, and the King’s Son turned to go beside him, and said merrily: “I give thee good even, my Lady’s Squire!  I owe thee something of courtesy, whereas it is by thy means that I shall be made happy, both tonight, and tomorrow, and many tomorrows; and sooth it is, that but little courtesy have I done thee hitherto.”</p>
			<p>His face was full of joy, and the eyes of him shone with gladness.  He was a goodly man, but to Walter he seemed an ill one; and he hated him so much, that he found it no easy matter to answer him; but he refrained himself, and said: “I can thee thank, King’s Son; and good it is that someone is happy in this strange land.”</p>
			<p>“Art thou not happy then, Squire of my Lady?” said the other.</p>
			<p>Walter had no mind to show this man his heart, nay, nor even a corner thereof; for he deemed him an enemy.  So he smiled sweetly and somewhat foolishly, as a man luckily in love, and said: “O yea, yea, why should I not be so?  How might I be otherwise?”</p>
			<p>“Yea then,” said the King’s Son, “why didst thou say that thou wert glad someone is happy?  Who is unhappy, deemest thou?” and he looked on him keenly.</p>
			<p>Walter answered slowly: “Said I so?  I suppose then that I was thinking of thee; for when first I saw thee, yea, and afterwards, thou didst seem heavyhearted and ill-content.”</p>
			<p>The face of the King’s Son cleared at this word, and he said: “Yea, so it was; for look you, both ways it was: I was unfree, and I had sown the true desire of my heart whereas it waxed not.  But now I am on the brink and verge of freedom, and presently shall my desire be blossomed.  Nay now, Squire, I deem thee a good fellow, though it may be somewhat of a fool; so I will no more speak riddles to thee.  Thus it is: the Maid hath promised me all mine asking, and is mine; and in two or three days, by her helping also, I shall see the world again.”</p>
			<p>Quoth Walter, smiling askance on him: “And the Lady? what shall she say to this matter?”</p>
			<p>The King’s Son reddened, but smiled falsely enough, and said: “Sir Squire, thou knowest enough not to need to ask this.  Why should I tell thee that she accounteth more of thy little finger than of my whole body?  Now I tell thee hereof freely; first, because this my fruition of love, and my freeing from thralldom, is, in a way, of thy doing.  For thou art become my supplanter, and hast taken thy place with yonder lovely tyrant.  Fear not for me! she will let me go.  As for thyself, see thou to it!  But again I tell thee hereof because my heart is light and full of joy, and telling thee will pleasure me, and cannot do me any harm.  For if thou say: How if I carry the tale to my Lady?  I answer, thou wilt not.  For I know that thine heart hath been somewhat set on the jewel that my hand holdeth; and thou knowest well on whose head the Lady’s wrath would fall, and that would be neither thine nor mine.”</p>
			<p>“Thou sayest sooth,” said Walter; “neither is treason my wont.”</p>
			<p>So they walked on silently a while, and then Walter said: “But how if the Maiden had nay-said thee; what hadst thou done then?”</p>
			<p>“By the heavens!” said the King’s Son fiercely, “she should have paid for her nay-say; then would I⁠—”  But he broke off, and said quietly, yet somewhat doggedly: “Why talk of what might have been?  She gave me her yea-say pleasantly and sweetly.”</p>
			<p>Now Walter knew that the man lied, so he held his peace thereon; but presently he said: “When thou art free wilt thou go to thine own land again?”</p>
			<p>“Yea,” said the King’s Son; “she will lead me thither.”</p>
			<p>“And wilt thou make her thy lady and queen when thou comest to thy father’s land?” said Walter.</p>
			<p>The King’s Son knit his brow, and said: “When I am in mine own land I may do with her what I will; but I look for it that I shall do no otherwise with her than that she shall be well-content.”</p>
			<p>Then the talk between them dropped, and the King’s Son turned off toward the wood, singing and joyous; but Walter went soberly toward the house.  Forsooth he was not greatly cast down, for besides that he knew that the King’s Son was false, he deemed that under this double tryst lay something which was a-doing in his own behalf.  Yet was he eager and troubled, if not downhearted, and his soul was cast about betwixt hope and fear.</p>
