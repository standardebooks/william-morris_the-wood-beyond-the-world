			</h2>
			<p>But as he went on through the fair and sweet land so bright and sun-litten, and he now rested and fed, the horror and fear ran off from him, and he wandered on merrily, neither did aught befall him save the coming of night, when he laid him down under a great spreading oak with his drawn sword ready to hand, and fell asleep at once, and woke not till the sun was high.</p>
			<p>Then he arose and went on his way again; and the land was no worser than yesterday; but even better, it might be; the greensward more flowery, the oaks and chestnuts greater.  Deer of diverse kinds he saw, and might easily have got his meat thereof; but he meddled not with them since he had his bread, and was timorous of lighting a fire.  Withal he doubted little of having some entertainment; and that, might be, nought evil; since even that fearful dwarf had been courteous to him after his kind, and had done him good and not harm.  But of the happening on the Wretch and the Thing, whereof the dwarf spake, he was yet somewhat afeard.</p>
			<p>After he had gone a while and whenas the summer morn was at its brightest, he saw a little way ahead a grey rock rising up from amidst of a ring of oak-trees; so he turned thither straightway; for in this plain-land he had seen no rocks heretofore; and as he went he saw that there was a fountain gushing out from under the rock, which ran thence in a fair little stream.  And when he had the rock and the fountain and the stream clear before him, lo! a child of Adam sitting beside the fountain under the shadow of the rock.  He drew a little nigher, and then he saw that it was a woman, clad in green like the sward whereon she lay.  She was playing with the welling out of the water, and she had trussed up her sleeves to the shoulder that she might thrust her bare arms therein.  Her shoes of black leather lay on the grass beside her, and her feet and legs yet shone with the brook.</p>
			<p>Belike amidst the splashing and clatter of the water she did not hear him drawing nigh, so that he was close to her before she lifted up her face and saw him, and he beheld her, that it was the maiden of the thrice-seen pageant.  She reddened when she saw him, and hastily covered up her legs with her gown-skirt, and drew down the sleeves over her arms, but otherwise stirred not.  As for him, he stood still, striving to speak to her; but no word might he bring out, and his heart beat sorely.</p>
			<p>But the maiden spake to him in a clear sweet voice, wherein was now no trouble: “Thou art an alien, art thou not?  For I have not seen thee before.”</p>
			<p>“Yea,” he said, “I am an alien; wilt thou be good to me?”</p>
			<p>She said: “And why not?  I was afraid at first, for I thought it had been the King’s Son.  I looked to see none other; for of goodly men he has been the only one here in the land this long while, till thy coming.”</p>
			<p>He said: “Didst thou look for my coming at about this time?”</p>
			<p>“O nay,” she said; “how might I?”</p>
			<p>Said Walter: “I wot not; but the other man seemed to be looking for me, and knew of me, and he brought me bread to eat.”</p>
			<p>She looked on him anxiously, and grew somewhat pale, as she said: “What other one?”</p>
			<p>Now Walter did not know what the dwarf might be to her, fellow-servant or what not, so he would not show his loathing of him; but answered wisely: “The little man in the yellow raiment.”</p>
			<p>But when she heard that word, she went suddenly very pale, and leaned her head aback, and beat the air with her hands; but said presently in a faint voice: “I pray thee talk not of that one while I am by, nor even think of him, if thou mayest forbear.”</p>
			<p>He spake not, and she was a little while before she came to herself again; then she opened her eyes, and looked upon Walter and smiled kindly on him, as though to ask his pardon for having scared him.  Then she rose up in her place, and stood before him; and they were nigh together, for the stream betwixt them was little.</p>
			<p>But he still looked anxiously upon her and said: “Have I hurt thee?  I pray thy pardon.”</p>
			<p>She looked on him more sweetly still, and said: “O nay; thou wouldst not hurt me, thou!”</p>
			<p>Then she blushed very red, and he in like wise; but afterwards she turned pale, and laid a hand on her breast, and Walter cried out hastily: “O me!  I have hurt thee again.  Wherein have I done amiss?”</p>
			<p>“In nought, in nought,” she said; “but I am troubled, I wot not wherefore; some thought hath taken hold of me, and I know it not.  Mayhappen in a little while I shall know what troubles me.  Now I bid thee depart from me a little, and I will abide here; and when thou comest back, it will either be that I have found it out or not; and in either case I will tell thee.”</p>
			<p>She spoke earnestly to him; but he said: “How long shall I abide away?”</p>
			<p>Her face was troubled as she answered him: “For no long while.”</p>
			<p>He smiled on her and turned away, and went a space to the other side of the oak-trees, whence she was still within eyeshot.  There he abode until the time seemed long to him; but he schooled himself and forbore; for he said: Lest she send me away again.  So he abided until again the time seemed long to him, and she called not to him: but once again he forbore to go; then at last he arose, and his heart beat and he trembled, and he walked back again speedily, and came to the maiden, who was still standing by the rock of the spring, her arms hanging down, her eyes downcast.  She looked up at him as he drew nigh, and her face changed with eagerness as she said: “I am glad thou art come back, though it be no long while since thy departure” (sooth to say it was scarce half an hour in all).  “Nevertheless I have been thinking many things, and thereof will I now tell thee.”</p>
			<p>He said: “Maiden, there is a river betwixt us, though it be no big one.  Shall I not stride over, and come to thee, that we may sit down together side by side on the green grass?”</p>
			<p>“Nay,” she said, “not yet; tarry a while till I have told thee of matters.  I must now tell thee of my thoughts in order.”</p>
			<p>Her colour went and came now, and she plaited the folds of her gown with restless fingers.  At last she said: “Now the first thing is this; that though thou hast seen me first only within this hour, thou hast set thine heart upon me to have me for thy speech-friend and thy darling.  And if this be not so, then is all my speech, yea and all my hope, come to an end at once.”</p>
			<p>“O yea!” said Walter, “even so it is: but how thou hast found this out I wot not; since now for the first time I say it, that thou art indeed my love, and my dear and my darling.”</p>
			<p>“Hush,” she said, “hush! lest the wood have ears, and thy speech is loud: abide, and I shall tell thee how I know it.  Whether this thy love shall outlast the first time that thou holdest my body in thine arms, I wot not, nor dost thou.  But sore is my hope that it may be so; for I also, though it be but scarce an hour since I set eyes on thee, have cast mine eyes on thee to have thee for my love and my darling, and my speech-friend.  And this is how I wot that thou lovest me, my friend.  Now is all this dear and joyful, and overflows my heart with sweetness.  But now must I tell thee of the fear and the evil which lieth behind it.”</p>
			<p>Then Walter stretched out his hands to her, and cried out: “Yea, yea!  But whatever evil entangle us, now we both know these two things, to wit, that thou lovest me, and I thee, wilt thou not come hither, that I may cast mine arms about thee, and kiss thee, if not thy kind lips or thy friendly face at all, yet at least thy dear hand: yea, that I may touch thy body in some wise?”</p>
			<p>She looked on him steadily, and said softly: “Nay, this above all things must not be; and that it may not be is a part of the evil which entangles us.  But hearken, friend, once again I tell thee that thy voice is over loud in this wilderness fruitful of evil.  Now I have told thee, indeed, of two things whereof we both wot; but next I must needs tell thee of things whereof I wot, and thou wottest not.  Yet this were better, that thou pledge thy word not to touch so much as one of my hands, and that we go together a little way hence away from these tumbled stones, and sit down upon the open greensward; whereas here is cover if there be spying abroad.”</p>
			<p>Again, as she spoke, she turned very pale; but Walter said: “Since it must be so, I pledge thee my word to thee as I love thee.”</p>
			<p>And therewith she knelt down, and did on her foot-gear, and then sprang lightly over the rivulet; and then the twain of them went side by side some half a furlong thence, and sat down, shadowed by the boughs of a slim quicken-tree growing up out of the greensward, whereon for a good space around was neither bush nor brake.</p>
			<p>There began the maiden to talk soberly, and said: “This is what I must needs say to thee now, that thou art come into a land perilous for any one that loveth aught of good; from which, forsooth, I were fain that thou wert gotten away safely, even though I should die of longing for thee.  As for myself, my peril is, in a measure, less than thine; I mean the peril of death.  But lo, thou, this iron on my foot is token that I am a thrall, and thou knowest in what wise thralls must pay for transgressions.  Furthermore, of what I am, and how I came hither, time would fail me to tell; but somewhile, maybe, I shall tell thee.  I serve an evil mistress, of whom I may say that scarce I wot if she be a woman or not; but by some creatures is she accounted for a god, and as a god is heried; and surely never god was crueller nor colder than she.  Me she hateth sorely; yet if she hated me little or nought, small were the gain to me if it were her pleasure to deal hardly by me.  But as things now are, and are like to be, it would not be for her pleasure, but for her pain and loss, to make an end of me, therefore, as I said e’en now, my mere life is not in peril with her; unless, perchance, some sudden passion get the better of her, and she slay me, and repent of it thereafter.  For so it is, that if it be the least evil of her conditions that she is wanton, at least wanton she is to the letter.  Many a time hath she cast the net for the catching of some goodly young man; and her latest prey (save it be thou) is the young man whom I named, when first I saw thee, by the name of the King’s Son.  He is with us yet, and I fear him; for of late hath he wearied of her, though it is but plain truth to say of her, that she is the wonder of all Beauties of the World.  He hath wearied of her, I say, and hath cast his eyes upon me, and if I were heedless, he would betray me to the uttermost of the wrath of my mistress.  For needs must I say of him, though he be a goodly man, and now fallen into thralldom, that he hath no bowels of compassion; but is a dastard, who for an hour’s pleasure would undo me, and thereafter would stand by smiling and taking my mistress’s pardon with good cheer, while for me would be no pardon.  Seest thou, therefore, how it is with me between these two cruel fools?  And moreover there are others of whom I will not even speak to thee.”</p>
			<p>And therewith she put her hands before her face, and wept, and murmured: “Who shall deliver me from this death in life?”</p>
			<p>But Walter cried out: “For what else am I come hither, I, I?”</p>
			<p>And it was a near thing that he did not take her in his arms, but he remembered his pledged word, and drew aback from her in terror, whereas he had an inkling of why she would not suffer it; and he wept with her.</p>
			<p>But suddenly the Maid left weeping, and said in a changed voice: “Friend, whereas thou speakest of delivering me, it is more like that I shall deliver thee.  And now I pray thy pardon for thus grieving thee with my grief, and that more especially because thou mayst not solace thy grief with kisses and caresses; but so it was, that for once I was smitten by the thought of the anguish of this land, and the joy of all the world besides.”</p>
			<p>Therewith she caught her breath in a half-sob, but refrained her and went on: “Now dear friend and darling, take good heed to all that I shall say to thee, whereas thou must do after the teaching of my words.  And first, I deem by the monster having met thee at the gates of the land, and refreshed thee, that the Mistress hath looked for thy coming; nay, by thy coming hither at all, that she hath cast her net and caught thee.  Hast thou noted aught that might seem to make this more like?”</p>
			<p>Said Walter: “Three times in full daylight have I seen go past me the images of the monster and thee and a glorious lady, even as if ye were alive.”</p>
			<p>And therewith he told her in few words how it had gone with him since that day on the quay at Langton.</p>
			<p>She said: “Then it is no longer perhaps, but certain, that thou art her latest catch; and even so I deemed from the first: and, dear friend, this is why I have not suffered thee to kiss or caress me, so sore as I longed for thee.  For the Mistress will have thee for her only, and hath lured thee hither for nought else; and she is wise in wizardry (even as some deal am I), and wert thou to touch me with hand or mouth on my naked flesh, yea, or were it even my raiment, then would she scent the savour of thy love upon me, and then, though it may be she would spare thee, she would not spare me.”</p>
			<p>Then was she silent a little, and seemed very downcast, and Walter held his peace from grief and confusion and helplessness; for of wizardry he knew nought.</p>
			<p>At last the Maid spake again, and said: “Nevertheless we will not die redeless.  Now thou must look to this, that from henceforward it is thee, and not the King’s Son, whom she desireth, and that so much the more that she hath not set eyes on thee.  Remember this, whatsoever her seeming may be to thee.  Now, therefore, shall the King’s Son be free, though he know it not, to cast his love on whomso he will; and, in a way, I also shall be free to yeasay him.  Though, forsooth, so fulfilled is she with malice and spite, that even then she may turn round on me to punish me for doing that which she would have me do.  Now let me think of it.”</p>
			<p>Then was she silent a good while, and spoke at last: “Yea, all things are perilous, and a perilous rede I have thought of, whereof I will not tell thee as yet; so waste not the short while by asking me.  At least the worst will be no worse than what shall come if we strive not against it.  And now, my friend, amongst perils it is growing more and more perilous that we twain should be longer together.  But I would say one thing yet; and maybe another thereafter.  Thou hast cast thy love upon one who will be true to thee, whatsoever may befall; yet is she a guileful creature, and might not help it her life long, and now for thy very sake must needs be more guileful now than ever before.  And as for me, the guileful, my love have I cast upon a lovely man, and one true and simple, and a stout-heart; but at such a pinch is he, that if he withstand all temptation, his withstanding may belike undo both him and me.  Therefore swear we both of us, that by both of us shall all guile and all falling away be forgiven on the day when we shall be free to love each the other as our hearts will.”</p>
			<p>Walter cried out: “O love, I swear it indeed! thou art my Hallow, and I will swear it as on the relics of a Hallow; on thy hands and thy feet I swear it.”</p>
			<p>The words seemed to her a dear caress; and she laughed, and blushed, and looked full kindly on him; and then her face grew solemn, and she said: “On thy life I swear it!”</p>
			<p>Then she said: “Now is there nought for thee to do but to go hence straight to the Golden House, which is my Mistress’s house, and the only house in this land (save one which I may not see), and lieth southward no long way.  How she will deal with thee, I wot not; but all I have said of her and thee and the King’s Son is true.  Therefore I say to thee, be wary and cold at heart, whatsoever outward semblance thou mayst make.  If thou have to yield thee to her, then yield rather late than early, so as to gain time.  Yet not so late as to seem shamed in yielding for fear’s sake.  Hold fast to thy life, my friend, for in warding that, thou wardest me from grief without remedy.  Thou wilt see me ere long; it may be to-morrow, it may be some days hence.  But forget not, that what I may do, that I am doing.  Take heed also that thou pay no more heed to me, or rather less, than if thou wert meeting a maiden of no account in the streets of thine own town.  O my love! barren is this first farewell, as was our first meeting; but surely shall there be another meeting better than the first, and the last farewell may be long and long yet.”</p>
			<p>Therewith she stood up, and he knelt before her a little while without any word, and then arose and went his ways; but when he had gone a space he turned about, and saw her still standing in the same place; she stayed a moment when she saw him turn, and then herself turned about.</p>
			<p>So he departed through the fair land, and his heart was full with hope and fear as he went.</p>
